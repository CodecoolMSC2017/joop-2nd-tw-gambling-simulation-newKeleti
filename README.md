### Running the program

* With the terminal open, navigate to the root directory of the repository (joop-2nd-tw-gambling-simulation-newKeleti).
* Use the following command:

* Entering the **number** is optional. This is how you can generate a given number of simulations.
* If you already have simulations generated, this isn't neccessary, since the program can read the generated
simulations and generate statistics based on those.
